INCLUDED FILES:


README:
	Identification information and a brief overview of the included files.


Makefile:
	Script that includes the default compilation command with "make". It also
	includes clean, which removes all files created by Makefile, and dist,
	which generates the tar.gz file.


lab3b.py:
	Python code that takes in a summary of a file system and checks for
	any inconsistencies including invalid blocks, reserved blocks, unreferenced
	blocks, etc. The input is in the same format as the output produced by
	lab3a in a .csv file.
	The program exits with 0 if execution was successful, 1 if execution was
	unsuccessful, and 2 if inconsistencies were found.
