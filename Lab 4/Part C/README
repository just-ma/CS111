Included Files:


README:
        Identification information and a brief overview of the included files.


Makefile:
        Script that includes the default compile of the lab4b executable. It also 
includes clean, which removes all files created the Makefile, check, which runs a 
sanity check on the executable, and dist, which builds the tar.gz file.


lab4c_tcp.c:
	C code for lab 4c part 1. It initializes temperature sensor and reports 
the temperature every specified period, much like lab 4b. The temperature could 
be specified to either Fahrenheit or Celsius. There was also a log option which 
would append all outputted data to a specified file. However, instead of outputs 
and inputs being standard output and input, information goes through a socket 
to a TCP server.

lab4c_tls.c:
	C code for lab 4c part 2. It's the same code as part 1, but we use ssl 
to read and write from and to a TLS server. This requires extra header files, 
and extra options when compiling.
